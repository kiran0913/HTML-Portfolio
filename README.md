# Digital Menu for Cafe Shop

Hi there I Using HTML to create a digital menu for The Milky Way Cafe was a fun and creative process. I started by carefully designing the menu's structure 
and layout to make sure it was both aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. I designed a responsive design with HTML so that it could easily adjust to 
various screen sizes and be accessed by customers on desktop computersÂ and tablets.
